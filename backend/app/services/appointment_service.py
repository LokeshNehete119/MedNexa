"""Booking, cancellation and rescheduling.

Concurrency: every write that takes a slot first locks the doctor's row
(SELECT ... FOR UPDATE), so availability checks, the daily cap and token
assignment for one doctor happen one transaction at a time. The partial unique
index on BOOKED slots is the final safety net. Lock order is always
doctor -> appointment, so these operations cannot deadlock each other.

Functions taking `caller_phone` are for the AI agent and enforce ownership;
the `*_by_staff` variants are for the admin dashboard.
